collision.cpp:
compute intersection between ellipsoid and single triangle, return collision bool, modify references to position and time
compute intersection between ellipsoid and many triangles, modify references to position and velocity

shapes.cpp:
ellipsoid no longer has passframe stuff, just stores radii, maybe a print function
same with triangle, but it never had passframe stuff in the first place

thing.cpp:
has Thing class which stores an object
think i might want to build it sort of like terraria tmodloader stuff
anyways, each Thing has:
position, velocity, rotation, etc.
hitbox: ellipsoid (or maybe some other shape sometime)
render thing: model, maybe function tied to model
pass frame: some function which passes that good frame
name?: maybe the name of the object
print?: some sorta print function perhaps

player.cpp (future stuff):
has Player class which has:
thing: Thing class
camera: Camera class
movement functions: for movin' around with the keyboard and mouse

game.cpp (far future stuff):
has Game class which has:
general game management stuff, initialization, and more

and maybe at some point, will finally do portals/non-euclidean stuffs! wouldn't that be fun.
