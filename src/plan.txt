collision.cpp:
(done) compute intersection between ellipsoid and single triangle, return collision bool, modify references to position and time
(done) compute intersection between ellipsoid and many triangles, modify references to position and velocity

shapes.cpp:
(done) ellipsoid no longer has passframe stuff, just stores radii, maybe a print function
ellipsoid should also have some function for transforming coordinates to ellipsoid-space
(done) same with triangle, but it never had passframe stuff in the first place

thing.cpp:
has Thing class which stores an object
think i might want to build it sort of like terraria tmodloader stuff
anyways, each Thing has:
(done) position, velocity, rotation, etc.
(done) hitbox: ellipsoid (or maybe some other shape sometime)
(done) render thing: model, maybe function tied to model
(done) pass frame: some function which passes that good frame
(done) name?: maybe the name of the object
print?: some sorta print function perhaps

player.cpp (future stuff):
has Player class which has:
thing: Thing class
camera: Camera class
movement functions: for movin' around with the keyboard and mouse

game.cpp (far future stuff):
has Game class which has:
general game management stuff, initialization, and more

and maybe at some point, will finally do portals/non-euclidean stuffs! wouldn't that be fun.
